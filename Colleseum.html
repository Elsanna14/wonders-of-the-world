        The Colosseum, also named the Flavian Amphitheater, is a large
        amphitheater in Rome. It was built during the reign of the Flavian
        emperors as a gift to the Roman people. Construction of the Colosseum
        began sometime between A.D. 70 and 72 under the emperor Vespasian. It
        opened nearly a decade later and was modified several times in the
        following years. The massive structure measured approximately 189 by 156
        meters (620 by 513 feet), towered four stories high, and included eighty
        entrances to the amphitheaterâ€”seventy-six for the patrons, two for
        participants of events, and two exclusively for the emperor to use. The
        sheer number of entrances proved to be necessary: the Colosseum could
        hold more than 50,000 spectators at its maximum capacity.

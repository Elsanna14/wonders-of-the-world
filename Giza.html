        The Great Pyramid of Giza is a defining symbol of Egypt and the last of
        the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. It is located on the Giza
        plateau near the modern city of Cairo and was built over a twenty-year
        period during the reign of the king Khufu (2589-2566 BCE, also known as
        Cheops) of the 4th Dynasty. Until the Eiffel Tower was completed in
        Paris, France in 1889 CE, the Great Pyramid was the tallest structure
        made by human hands in the world; a record it held for over 3,000 years
        and one unlikely to be broken. Other scholars have pointed to the
        Lincoln Cathedral spire in England, built in 1300 CE, as the structure
        which finally surpassed the Great Pyramid in height but, still, the
        Egyptian monument held the title for an impressive span of time. The
        pyramid rises to a height of 479 feet (146 metres) with a base of 754
        feet (230 metres) and is comprised of over two million blocks of stone.
